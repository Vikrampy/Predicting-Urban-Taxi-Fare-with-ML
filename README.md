# Predicting-Urban-Taxi-Fare-with-ML
Understanding the Data and Choose Best Feature and Model for the Taxi Fare Prediction.

As a Data Analyst at an urban mobility analytics firm, your mission is to unlock insights from real-world taxi trip data to enhance fare estimation systems and promote pricing transparency for passengers. This project focuses on analyzing historical taxi trip records collected from a metropolitan transportation network.

The goal is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the total taxi fare amount based on various ride-related features. Learners will preprocess the raw data, engineer meaningful features, handle data quality issues, train and evaluate multiple regression models, and finally deploy the best-performing model using Streamlit.
